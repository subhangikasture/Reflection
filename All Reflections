#Reflection 2
 
Look up Table
*Time complexity for processing O(n^2)
*n^2 space 
*Time required to fetch a value 1

Square root Decomposition
*Processing O(n)
*Excess time and space Square root of N
 Can be used only if query access the entire range

Segment Tree 
*Height of tree log(n)
*size of memory allocated 2*2^[logn]-1

comments:
If values are static then go for segment Tree technique
for Dynamic values Look up table method and square root decomposition is preferred


Reflecion 1
BINARY COEFFICIENT:
Three methods were used
1.Recursive 
*memory used o(2^n-1)*16
*time complexity o(n*k)

2.2D array method
*memory used n*k
*time complexity o(n*k)

3.1D memory method 
*space complexity O(k)


comments:
If single query is used then go for recursive 
If multiple is present 2D array method is good 
To fetch a single row coefficients 1D method is better
