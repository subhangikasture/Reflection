##BIONOMIAL COEFFICIENT 
It uses two for loops hence 0(N*k) in Dynamic programing and one if condition to get the min(i,k)
if you use recursive then it becomes more complex
The coeficient is found usig the relation c(n,k)=c(n-1,k-1)+c(n-1,k)

##PASCAL TRIANGLE
It can generated with the help of Bionomial Coefficients 
Using Dynamic programing we need to use two for loops and one if condition
we can do ot using recursion as well but it is more complex and takes more number of iterations

##CADONES ALGORITHM
1.Kadones algorithm finds the sum of largest sub array 
2.two variables are maintained one with temp and other is max
3.we add element to temp each time if it is less than 0 then we make temp as 0
4.and if max is lass than temp then make temp as max
5.step 3 and 4 are repeated n number of times 
6.max value is returned
